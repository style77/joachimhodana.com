This is the source code for my personal website. It is built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

Keep in mind that i'm not a web developer, so the code might not be the best, but it works 😅.
Thanks to [Blueedge](https://github.com/blueedgetechno/win11React) for the inspiration and open source code of his windows 11 simulator, which i used as a base (basically copied most of styles, but i'm not a designer, so i don't care 😁).
